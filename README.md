#Quiz_Javascript_Fundementals

For this challenge I utilised skills learnt for JavaScript, in order to create a timed quiz that stores high scores which can be stored and my progress compared to my peers.

My application works as follows:

- The quiz begins when the user clicks on the start button.
- The timer begins to count down at the start of the quiz.
- When the user answers the question, they are told if the answer is correct or incorrect before being presented with another question.
- For every incorrect question 10 seconds is subtracted from the timer.
- The game is over when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
- When the game is over, the user can input their initials to save the score the highscore section.
- The user can remove the information (initials) from the highscore page by clicking the clear button.
